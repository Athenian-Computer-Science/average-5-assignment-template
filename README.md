# Average x 

## Problem Description
Write a function that takes input numbers and returns their average. Use the starter code to help you with format.

In the `main` part of the program, ask the user for the numbers to be averaged. 

## Example
```
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2

3
```

## Suggested Approach
1) Your function should have parameters that represent the values to be averaged.
2) The function should return the average (called `average`).
3) The inputs should be gathered in 'main' and used as arguments in the function call.
4) Test your code when you think it works (pytest).
