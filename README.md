# Average 5 

## Problem Description
Write a function that takes 5 numbers and returns their average. Use the starter code to help you with format.

In the `main` part of the program, ask the user for 5 numbers. You should do this in 5 requests - feel free to use a loop to make it more elegant.

## Example
```
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2

3
```

## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
